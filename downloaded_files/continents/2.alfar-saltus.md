# Alfar Saltus

![Otiosa Silver](/alfar-saltus.webp)

Alfar Saltus is a mystical, forested continent known as the homeland of the elves and other nature-bound beings like nymphs, spirits, and fae. Ruled by the high elves, it is a place of elegance and prestige, where elven nobles embody grace and beauty. At its heart lies Otiosa Silver, the capital city nestled within a living fortress of trees. Here, the legendary Yggdrasill, or World Tree, stands as both a symbol of life and a powerful, otherworldly guardian. Humans and dwarves are forbidden to set foot on Alfar Saltus, maintaining the continent's secrecy and purity. The architecture and design are inspired by nature, merging seamlessly with the landscape and reflecting the elves' deep connection to the natural world.
