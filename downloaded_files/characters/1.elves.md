# Legolos

The Elves, known in their own language as Tel-quessir, are considered the fairest and wisest of the races. Alongside dragons, they were the only beings capable of coherent speech from the moment they were first created. They are a long-lived race that excels in magic, with immunity to illness and freedom from aging after reaching their prime. Elves can only be killed through violence or extreme despair. High Elves, much like dragons, are immortal and are thought to have the purest bloodline, closest to the original Elves.

## History of the Elves

Elves were created by a god who valued elegance and strength above all. Their god made them immortal to prevent his creations from becoming corrupted or vulgar, and their bodies did not visually age after maturity. However, Elves could still die from physical injury or by losing the will to live after many eons. This contributed to their belief that they were superior to other races, seeing only dragons as their equals.

Elves typically come of age around fifty years old and often marry at this time. Those who marry late or never are believed to have unusual fates. Elves can discern whether another Elf is married by their eyes and voice. It is against their nature to take anotherâ€™s spouse by force, as an Elf who is forcibly taken would reject life and die. Due to the union of souls when Elves marry and the eternal nature of their souls, they do not divorce or marry multiple times. Though incest is taboo, marriage among second cousins was acceptable, though the genetic dangers remain unclear.

## Physical Attributes and Appearance

Elves are known for their extraordinary beauty in both face and body. There is little physical difference between males and females except for reproductive purposes. They possess far better vision and hearing than humans and have abilities that far exceed those of mankind. Many Elves are skilled in crafting seemingly magical objects.

Elves possess ethereal grace and many powers. They are light-footed, able to travel long distances without leaving tracks and can even walk lightly across snow where humans would sink. While they do require sleep, they can enter a waking meditative state to regain strength. Despite their many advantages, Elves can tire and succumb to adverse environments and hunger, requiring sustenance to survive.

## Abilities and Skills

Elves have several unique abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races:

- Heightened Senses: Elves are supremely aware of their surroundings, with heightened senses of sight and sound. They can see in low light conditions without difficulty.
- Agility and Dexterity: Elves are agile and dexterous, allowing them to move swiftly through rough terrain. Their accuracy in attacks is unusually precise compared to other races.

## Reverie (Trance)

Elves do not sleep in the traditional sense but instead enter a meditative state known as reverie or "trance." This state is as restful as true sleep but allows them to remain aware of their surroundings. Elves require roughly two-thirds of the time humans need to rest. Additionally, their ability to trance often makes them resistant to supernatural powers such as sleep, as they do not truly sleep in the usual manner but remain in a semi-aware state.
